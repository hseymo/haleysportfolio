            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Haley and I am happy to have you here, exploring my content! I currently live in Seattle, WA (where I was born and raised). I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Athletic Training from Chapman University (Orange, CA). I am a nationally certified Athletic Trainer (ATC) through the Board of Certification and am licensed to practice in the state of Washington (LAT) through the Department of Health. Athletic Trainers are health care professionals whom render services including primary care, injury and illness prevention, wellness promotion and education, emergent care, examination and clinical diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation of injuries and medical conditions. Athletic Trainers provide services under the direction of a physician and are recognized as allied health care professionals by the American Medical Association (AMA), Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
            <br><br>
            For over six years I was employed by Seattle Children's Hospital. For the first three years I held a variety of roles and responsibilies including: providing sideline and off-field athletic training services to middle and high school athletes (primarily at the Bush School), educating and creating exercise programs for Cystic Fibrosis patients, and planning/teaching CPR and First Aid classes for coaches, adults and teenagers. For the recent half of my time at Children's, I worked alongside our Primary Care Sports Medicine (PCSM) pediatricians and sports surgical teams in the Orthopedics Clinic where we treated a variety of injuries from fractures to dislocations and overuse/stress injuries. Working in the clinical setting was a brand new role when I was hired. I was one of three Athletic Trainers whom built this position from the ground up, including hiring and onboarding new employees as we expanded the role. Other responsibilies included standardizing policies and procedures across the department and leading the team on our journey to implement a new electronic medical record system (EPIC).
            <br><br>
            As of February 2022, I decided to move on from patient care and Athletic Training. I am interested in pursuing a career in which I am constantly problem-solving and intellectually stimulated. I want to contribute my hard-working and innovative mindset to a challenging role at a company that has the passion and drive to succeed as well as offers opportunity to grow. Due to my interest in technology, blockchain, and Web3, I decided to try Web Development. I began the full stack flex bootcamp through Univeristy of Washington's Professional and Continuing Education Program. I am currently enrolled in the full time program with an anticipated 'graduation' date of 6/13/2022. As of writing this we have completed our second week of the program and have learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript. We are currently learning jQuery and Bootstrap. I am loving the program and enjoying using my new skills to put together projects like you see on this page!
            <br><br>
            Some skills that I have to offer include: excellent customer service and communication, internal drive, passion for excellence, an innovative and solution-oriented mindset, eagerness to learn, commitment to deliver results, integrity, leadership and onboarding experience with employee retention, experienced teacher and presenter to groups up to 150 people. For a full list of my licenses/certifications, publications and presentations, please contact me.
            <br><br>
            When I am not working or learning to code, I enjoy living an active lifestyle. I enjoy my volunteer role with Girls on The Run (Puget Sound) where I teach a team of third to fifth grade girls valuable life skills and empowerment through movement. I like to ride the Peloton and run on the Tread as well as outside. I enjoy group fitness classes (especially lagree), hiking in the PNW, cross-country skiing, listening to country music and attending concerts, trying new foods as well as wine, reading and listening to audiobooks, and spending time with family/friends.

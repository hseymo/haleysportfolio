DESCRIPTION: 
This is project to build a portfolio page. During the hiring process, a potential employer will want to see my portfolio of deployed projects in a clear and well put-together webpage. This will allow them to review samples of my work and assess if I'm a good candidate for an open position. HTML and CSS are the two languages used on this page. The build for this page focuses on utilizing flexboxes, media queries and CSS pseuoclasses. 

The criteria for this project include:
-Presentation of my name and a recent photo when the page loads.
-Nav bar links to different sections including 'about me', my 'work', and how to contact me (later on I will add a resume page; currently redirects to a 'coming soon' page). The UI should scroll to the section when clicked. 
-When the employer clicks of the section for my work, they are taken to a section with titled images of my deployed applications (placeholders used for now). 
    -The first application appears large than the rest.
    -Then the employer hovers over a project, a pseudoclass activates some effects. 
    -When the employer clicks on the image for an application, they are taken to the deployed application. 
-When the page is resized for viewed from different screen sizes, the page adapts to my viewport.

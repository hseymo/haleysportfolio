            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Haley and I am happy to have you here, exploring my content! I currently live in Seattle, WA, where I was born and raised. I am a front-end web developer with 6+ years of experience as a licensed healthcare professional. I would like to grow a career in the tech industry that incorporates my extensive background in Sports Medicine, healthcare, and fitness. I am interested in an ambitious and passionate role that allows me to contribute my solution-focused and innovative mindset. I am currently pursuing a web development coding certificate through the University of Washingtonâ€™s Full Stack MERN program. I have developed skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery and look forward to growing my wealth of knowledge through this full time program (anticipated graduation June 2022). So far I have led a team of four in building and deploying a front-end website utilizing server-side APIs to generate ideas to cure your boredom, suggesting an activity based on your preferences, and also allowing you to favorite or journal about experiences while saving to local storage. <br><br>
            Former colleagues would describe me as their go-to person for problem solving, superuser of our electronic medical record, being known for my attention to detail, integrity, adaptability and leadership. Experienced communicator as a teacher, presenter, and patient-care provider. My thirst to always be learning, passion for excellence, comfort in a fast-paced environment, internal drive and commitment to deliver results make me the ideal candidate for a quality-focused Junior Software Developer position. I am looking for a challenging role within a company that is spirited, driven to succeed, and offers opportunities for growth. <br><br>
            I am a BOC Certified Athletic Trainer (AT) and am licensed to practice in WA by the DOH. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training from Chapman University. In February 2022 I ended an employment of over 6 years at Seattle Children's Hospital. During that time I was the head Athletic Trainer at The Bush School, lead for our CPR program, Cystic Fibrosis Exercise Specialist, and one of the first Athletic Trainers in a brand new role that brought ATs into the Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Clinic. <br><br>
            My hobbies include innovation, volunteer coaching for Girls on The Run Puget Sound, country music, sports medicine, hiking, soccer, Peloton, reading, spending time with friends/family, and interior design. I am a member of ATPPS, NATA and the Gamma Phi Beta sorority.
